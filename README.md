# Goal
Identify data from dataset, analyze data from data set, interpret the data in ways that it could be useful

# Summary
This dataset contained many columns, so in order to utilize the data, I decided to drop some unecessary columns. There's a lot of info that could be found from this dataset so in order to use clean and narrow the data down in order to utizilize for data visualization, I used SQL.
I made many xlsx files and different dashboards, and below is what I found from this dataset.

# Results
### East Region
The East Region had the most total sales sitting at 592.17K. Looking deeper into the visualization we can see that Office Supplies had the most sales out of Furniture and Technology. Even though Technology contributes the most to the sum of sales, we discover that the east region focuses more on office supplies. The Average monthly sales was around 104.11. The East region was able to profit 85.29k. For shipping cost we see that delivery truck and regular air spent around the same amount.  

### West Region
The West Region contributed 526.78k to the total sales. Looking deeper into the visualization we can see that Technology had the most sales out of Furniture and Office Supplies. We also find the the West region contributed to the most sales in the techonology category. The Average monthly sales was around 93.40. The West region was able to profit 75.84k. For shipping cost we see that delivery truck was mainly used instead of regular air and express air.

### South Region
The South Region contributed 357.11K to the total sales. Looking deeper into the visualization we can see that technology had the most sales out of Furniture and office supplies. The south region appears to be lacking in contributing to the total sales. All three product generated around the same amount of sales. We also find that the south region is the only region that generated negative profit.The Average monthly sales was around 67.33. For shipping cost we see that the south doesnt get many orders since they spent the least amount of money on the shipping cost.

### Central Region
The Central Region had the most total sales sitting at 448.28K. Looking deeper into the visualization we can see that technology had the most sales out of Furniture and office supplies. We also find out that the central region spent the most money on shipping cost, even though they didnt generate the most sales. The Average monthly sales was around 66. The central region was able to profit 77.37k. 

# Interpreting the Results
Although this data doesnt have data from other years, we can still use the data to try to identify what we are lacking in. I believe that we should focus on each regions strength. Looking at the total quanity from each product category, we know that office supplies are in high demand and they generated the most sales in the product category within the east region. With this information, we can see that the business could do promotions to could focus on office supplies, since this region is most profitable through the east region. The West region generated the most sales in the technology category and therefore should promote and focus their advertisement more on technology. The central region seems to contribute the second most to technology in the sum of sales. South region contributed the least to the sales in all categories. The south region needs to re evaluate the whole plan since it generated negative profit. In order to advertise, we need to look at the demographic that we are working with, who is buying these products, and why they are buying it. Depending on the demographic, we could advertise towards those demographic and see which approach to advertise through. Then with the next year, we could analyze trends and forecast our earnings.
