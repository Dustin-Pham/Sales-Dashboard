# Summary
This dataset contained many columns, so in order to utilize the data, I decided to drop some unecessary columns. There's a lot of info that could be found from this dataset so in order to use clean and narrow the data down in order to utizilize for data visualization, I used SQL.
I made many xlsx files and different dashboards, and below is what I found from this dataset.
